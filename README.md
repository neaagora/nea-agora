# Nea Agora

**Exploring discovery and trust infrastructure for the agent economy.**

Exploring the infrastructure that could let AI agents discover and communicate with local businesses.

> This repository will evolve gradually as ideas solidify into public artifacts.

## The Vision

AI agents can reason brilliantly. But they can't reliably discover or talk to real businesses.

**Nea Agora explores a missing layer of infrastructure, including:**

- How agents discover real-world businesses
- How trust might be established between agents and businesses
- How agents and existing websites could communicate safely

Think of it as **business cards for robots** - simple JSON files that any agent can read and understand.

## The Problem

Six months ago, someone asked Gemini to book a haircut.  
It couldn't.

Not because it wasn't smart enough - Gemini is brilliant.  
But it had no way to actually *talk* to the barber's website.

It could search Google. Show links. Tell the hours.  
But *book* an appointment? No.

**That infrastructure doesn't exist. We're building it.**

---

## The Solution

Illustrative example (not a final schema):

```json
{
  "name": "Joe's Pizza",
  "capabilities": ["delivery", "takeout", "dine-in"],
  "contact": { "...": "..." }
}
```

Along with ideas around safe interaction and graceful fallback.

## Current Status

This project is at an early exploratory stage.  
Ideas are being tested, discarded, and refined in public.

## For Developers

**As public artifacts begin to appear, developers will be able to:**

- Fork it, improve it, use it
- Build wrapper agents for your clients
- Integrate it with your consumer agent
- Tell us what doesn't make sense

## For Businesses

You don't need to understand the technical details.

Eventually, you'll just describe your business:  
*"Flower shop in Lisbon, closed Sundays, delivery within 5km"*

And you'll get your agent-discoverable presence.  
AI agents can find you. Bookings happen automatically.

Until then, watch the journey unfold.

## Why This Matters

There's massive agent development happening:

- Google's A2A (Agent-to-Agent)
- Anthropic's MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- OpenAI's agent frameworks

But nobody's solving **discovery**, i.e, how agents find and trust local businesses in the open economy.

That's the gap Nea Agora fills.

**Complementary infrastructure, not competition.**

## What This Isn't

Not a startup.  
Not a product (yet).  
Not trying to disrupt anything.

Just infrastructure that needs to exist for the agent economy.

No blockchain. No tokens. No "paradigm shift."  
Just a cup of tea and some JSON files.
